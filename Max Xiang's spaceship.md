# Yancheng_Xiang_Portfolio

Hi!
Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Yancheng Xiang but I also go by Max, feel free to call me whichever name you like. I am currently a Master in Business Analytics student who is looking to climb higher in Data Analyst career. I firmly believe that all sort of programming languages are just tools, the analytical thinking is the core, and I am trying my best to hone both skills.  

Here's a little space for me to share my projects, experience or thoughts.
